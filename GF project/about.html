            <h2>A Love as Thrilling as a Horror Movie</h2>
            <p>Our love story is like a gripping horror movie, filled with unexpected twists and turns. Just like in those films, you've been the fearless heroine of my life, and I've been your unwavering protector.</p>
            <p>Our love is as intense as an "Attack on Titan" episode, battling life's challenges side by side, and I promise to be your Mikasa, always there to protect you.</p>
            <p>And like a basketball game, we've had our share of ups and downs, but with you, every moment has been a slam dunk. I cherish every court we've played on, and I look forward to countless more.</p>
            <p>With you, life is an exciting adventure, and I can't wait for more thrilling chapters in our love story.</p>
