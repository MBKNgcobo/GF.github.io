            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>It started with a swipe and a bad knock knock joke, who would have thought that we would be here, in love .</p>
			<p> It went from all night calls and a long distance to all night strokes and never wanting to be distant</p>
			<p> A love story that is regular but nothing about us is ever going to be regular</p>
			<p> I love you. From your silly jokes that you got from me to your competitiveness, from the love you show to your family 
			to the passion you show about teaching</P>
			<p> To many more memories</p>
